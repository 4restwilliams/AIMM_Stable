The Aerial Imagery Migration Model (AIMM) is tool for estimating the volume of sediment lost to lateral riverbank erosion. The tool requires two RGBI images of a river corridor and a high-resolution DEM as inputs and outputs a map of river migration as well as polygons of erosion and deposition with associated volumes.
